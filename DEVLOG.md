# Development Log
<!-- A day-to-day log of my existence as this is developed -->

### 2 May, 2025

The beginning of the beginning, very cool. This is the beginning of the project, stuff gets laid out here, the ground floor is being setup. Mostly markdown and document files with only a little bit of Lua code today. Of the little Lua written, it's mostly a Love2D template to get things started. A decent bit of work into the readme, mostly a shell of a readme, it'll be worked on as the project evolves. I've also planned to do weekly devlogs, or as close to weekly as possible. Each Sunday night (Sunday night for me) I'll be compiling the previous weeks work into a video format and posting it on my [YouTube Channel]() as a more concrete archive of development, and maybe to spark some interest in the project.

This video log series will not start on *this coming Sunday* (4 May, 2025), but rather the following Sunday (11 May, 2025), since I think talking openly about this would be a better approach than just endless words yapping away forever and ever.

Just finished the basic system for the player, which is awesome progress for me. I even threw in sprinting, but no asset rendering yet since I do not have any art created yet. But hopefully in a couple days I will!
