## Overview of the World
<!-- All names are subject to changes! -->

So, the entire playable world is the city itself - *"Neon City"* - a plain name, I know. It's subject to change. However, in this city are **four** major districts that make up the entire city:

### Aether Spire

The most elite of districts, a sterile, corporate landscape where everything is artifical and compliant. This is where the most powerful live their lives, managing thousands of people below them blindly, uncaring about how the affects rattle an already fragile system. This is where the journey should end with the final toppling of the systems in power, ending the game. Getting into the Spire is quite hard, as you must meet the compliance rules, which will be elaborated upon much later.

### Hollowstep

The largest district, most of the population lives here, and besides some small things, it's just your typical day-to-day city. People working their 9-5s, out shopping, partying, enjoying the vibes of the city. Here is where you see the small details of the general weirdness that echos through the city, maybe some persons clothes is a little more revealing than expected, maybe there are odd sounds coming from that alley... other than those, the district is just... most of the city. The vast majority of the game will happen here as a result of this.

### Lunar Row

Because of its location being partially underground and at the far reaches of the city, this district gained its name for feeling like its in a 24/7 bath of twilight and an ocean of neon glow from the districts above. Here is where the weirdness amps up, as almost the entire district is a 24/7 hardcore nightclub. Everywhere you go, there's music, dancing, drinks, some stuff to make you real good, and a lot of rules are loosened up or flat out ignored down here. 

### Vanta

A place darker than darkness itself, home to the criminal underground that make really keeps the city going. Few missions will take you here, but what you can find here will certainly surprise you...
